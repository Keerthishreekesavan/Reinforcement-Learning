# Reinforcement-Learning
This repository contains a collection of experiments focused on Reinforcement Learning (RL) concepts and algorithms. It includes implementations of foundational components such as agents, environments, reward mechanisms, and policies, as well as hands on projects like multi-armed bandits and Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). 

üìÇContents
‚úÖ Experiment 1: Implementation of a Basic Reinforcement Learning System
Simulates a simple toy problem.
Task: An agent starts at position 0 and tries to reach position 5.
Actions: Move +1 or -1.
Reward: +10 at position 5, 0 elsewhere.
Components:
Agent
Environment
States
Actions
Reward system

ü§ñ Experiment 2: Greedy Agent
Implementation of a purely greedy policy.
The agent always selects the action that currently seems best (highest known reward).
Demonstrates the limitations of greedy methods due to lack of exploration.

üé∞ Experiment 3: Multi-Armed Bandits using OpenAI Gym
Simulates the classic multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem using the OpenAI Gym API.
Implements:
Epsilon-Greedy Policy
Softmax Policy
Upper Confidence Bound (UCB)
Thompson Sampling
üí° MAB Use Case: Best Ad Selection
Reads a CSV file with click-through rates (CTR) for different advertisements.
Uses the epsilon-greedy approach to balance exploration and exploitation.
Tracks:
Number of times each ad is shown
Total reward (clicks)
Identifies the best-performing ad over time.

üåç Experiment 4: Exploring Different RL Environments
Examines various RL environments.
Formulates the problem in terms of Markov Decision Processes (MDP):
States
Actions
Transition probabilities
Rewards
Policy

‚ôªÔ∏è Experiment 5: Recycling Robot Simulation
Models a robot that performs recycling tasks using RL.
Emphasis on environment design, reward shaping, and long-term planning.

üßÆ Experiment 6: Value Iteration and Policy Iteration
Classical algorithms used to solve MDPs.
Compares convergence and performance of both methods.
Useful for grid-worlds and discrete state spaces.

üîß Technologies Used
Python
OpenAI Gym
NumPy
Pandas
Matplotlib (for visualizations)
Jupyter Notebooks

üìö Learning Objectives
Understand and implement core RL concepts.
Explore action-selection strategies in stochastic environments.
Gain hands on experience with MDPs and dynamic programming techniques.
Apply RL to real-world inspired problems like ad optimization and robotics.
