# Reinforcement-Learning
This repository contains a collection of experiments focused on Reinforcement Learning (RL) concepts and algorithms. It includes implementations of foundational components such as agents, environments, reward mechanisms, and policies, as well as hands on projects like multi-armed bandits and Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). 

üîç Topics Covered

- Toy RL environment (position-based)
- Greedy and Epsilon-Greedy Agents
- Multi-Armed Bandits (MAB)
- Ad Selection Simulation using MAB
- Value Iteration & Policy Iteration
- Recycling Robot problem
- Markov Decision Processes (MDPs)

üîß Technologies Used
- Python
- OpenAI Gym
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib (for visualizations)
- Jupyter Notebooks

üìö Learning Objectives 
- Understand and implement core RL concepts.
- Explore action-selection strategies in stochastic environments.
- Gain hands on experience with MDPs and dynamic programming techniques.
- Apply RL to real world inspired problems like ad optimization and robotics.
